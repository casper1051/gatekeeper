# gatekeeper
Simple system-d based proxy service for managing private networking systems. It forwards any connections connecting to it to any local LAN IP using socat.
Honestly I just put this here for my own easy use for private network systems.

Install it via
```bash 
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/casper1051/gatekeeper/main/install.sh | bash
```
